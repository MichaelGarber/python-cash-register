# Register

This program takes in the price of an item, amount given, and change in drawer. It tells the user how much change needs to be given, or if there is change left. This program is based on [this project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/cash-register)

# Mistakes and changes
- Set the variable to cash and customer1.cash had a higher number than the result i na calculator. I changed the variable.
- The customer1 cash variable started at 20. Now it starts at 0.
- Looked up notes from class and 2d arrays.
- Moved the change function from the initial function to the class functions
- Learned how to use status as a string and function
- Checked the regular for loops to see if it will work.
- Fixed out of range by adding the pos > 0 condition in the loop
- Made and instead of or
- The money item was many brackets. I had to fix it so now it is on array.
- Changed ```customer1.cid[0][pos][1]```  to ```money[pos]``` when comparing with change
- Calculated total change when you were supposed to calculate change to give
- Changed the change variable in the class to total
- Called one function in the class in another function in the class
- decided to put stuff in different files
- In my sort I forgot to assign the variable to the sort. I fixed it. The above link taught me to sort.
-  Wrote == for  one point where I needed to write =
- changed self.total = self.total * 100 / 100 to self.total = round(self.total,2)
- Removed the class, and the penny was added. With the class, the penny did not add up with the total in the last test
